A more organized version of the stylesheet for the Duelyst subreddit.

## How to run

**First install Node**. The are various ways to do this depending on your platform; if you're using Mac OS X then Homebrew is your best bet. For Windows, installing it with their own installer is the way to go.
After that, you want to run `npm install` in a terminal in the project folder to get the LESS package.

**Now write some LESS code**. If you're unfamiliar with how LESS works, check out their documentation.

**Compile!** Simply run `npm run css` which contains the LESS script for compiling the LESS files into a minified CSS file, which can then be pasted into the stylesheet textbox in the subreddit editing tool.
